This plugin is early beta and has limited data, however as our database of dark patterns grow you will be able to view what dark patterns may exist on the websites you browse.

What is a dark pattern?
Dark patterns are when websites and products hide beneficial features for users that may not be so beneficial to the business or use tricky language and imagery to force a user to take or not take an action. Some examples include:

Causing problems when people want to unsubscribe from a newsletter
Hiding registration options so people feel the only way to register is through social media
Showing pricing in an unclear way to get users to go towards a specific package (that may not necessarily be the best package)

In other words, arguably unethical trickery on the end users to gain something, whether intentional or not.
